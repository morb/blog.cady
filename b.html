        <h6>Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal<br>
Fear is how I fall <br>
Confusing what is real<br>
There's something inside me that pulls <br> beneath the surface <br>
Consuming, confusing<br>
This lack of self control I fear is never <br> ending
Controlling
I can't seem <br>
To find myself again <br>
My walls are closing in <br>
(Without a sense of confidence I'm convinced <br>
That there's just too much pressure to take)<br>
I've felt this way before
So insecure
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Discomfort, endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting how I can't seem
To find myself again
My walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence I'm convinced
That there's just too much pressure to take)
I've felt this way before
So insecure
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming (confusing what is real)
This lack of self control I fear is never ending
Controlling (confusing what is real)</h6>
